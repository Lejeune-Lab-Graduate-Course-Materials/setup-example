The purpose of this repository is to document an outline of the steps that go into setting up a very basic software development environment. This specific configuration is not mandatory for the ME 500 class, but we believe that the strategies suggested here will be helpful and useful. In some places, I have used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to make creating this readme file easier. Any text primarily written by ChatGPT is reported in *italic font* (in some cases I have made edits and/or added additional information). I have independently verified all text generated by ChatGPT and take responsibility for its content. For each general concept, I encourage you to learn more on your own as is helpful to your understanding. The first assignment for this class will involve learning by doing.

### General Philosophy <a name="phil"></a>

One of the goals of this course is to increase comfort with open source software (both as a user and as a potential contributor). When using open source software, it's important to learn how to figure things out as you go along, and not overly rely on being able to follow a step by step tutorial for everything that you need to do (though well done tutorials are fantastic!). When something doesn't work as initially planned, there are several different strategies that you can use to figure out what to do next (e.g., take some time to think about the problem, try and break the problem down into smaller more manageable pieces, search online for an answer, post on a forum etc.). The best next step will depend on the problem, and figuring out how to navigate this is part of the process. To this end, please view this setup guide as a resource page rather than a specific list of instructions. It will require some non-trivial amount of effort to get comfortable with all of these tools -- that is normal!

### Command Line <a name="cmd"></a>
```
how do you concisely define the terminal (computer programming)?
```

ChatGPT:

*In computer programming, a terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system by entering and executing commands, typically through a command-line shell like Bash or Command Prompt. It is used for tasks such as running scripts, managing files, and controlling processes.*

```
how do you access the terminal on linux, max, and windows machines respectively?
```
ChatGPT:

*Linux: Most Linux distributions have a terminal pre-installed.
To open it, press Ctrl + Alt + T or search for "Terminal" in the application menu.*

*macOS: Open Spotlight Search (press Cmd + Space) and type "Terminal." Alternatively, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.*

*Windows: For the Command Prompt, press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter. For PowerShell, press Win + X and choose Windows PowerShell or search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu. Alternatively, use Windows Terminal by searching "Windows Terminal" in the Start menu (available in recent versions). Please note that newest version of PowerShell might not be installed automatically on your machine and updating may be preferible.*

Overall, the best way to learn how to use the terminal is to just give it a try! The resources provided below include tutorials to get started on your own computer. Basic abilities in command line programming will be necesary for this course.

### Test Driven Development via pytest <a name="tdd"></a>

```
what is test driven development?
```

ChatGPT:

*Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process emphasizes writing test cases for each small functionality and then developing the code to make those tests pass. Key features and steps of TDD include:*

1. *Write a Test: First, you write a unit test for a specific function or feature that will fail because the code doesn’t exist yet.*
2. *Run the Test: Run the test to confirm it fails, ensuring the test is valid and that the functionality is not yet implemented.*
3. *Write the Code: Develop the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass.*
4. *Run the Test Again: Run the test suite to check if the new code passes the test.*
5. *Refactor the Code: Clean up the code, optimizing it without changing its behavior, ensuring the tests still pass.*
6. *Repeat the Cycle: This process is repeated for every new feature or functionality, ensuring that all code is thoroughly tested.*

*Benefits of TDD:*
1. *Improves Code Quality: Since tests are written first, the code is generally more reliable, with fewer bugs.*
2. *Encourages Simplicity: Developers focus on writing just enough code to pass the tests, avoiding unnecessary complexity.*
3. *Facilitates Refactoring: Tests ensure that refactoring the code doesn’t introduce new bugs.*
4. *Promotes Better Design: Writing tests forces developers to think about the design and functionality of the code upfront.*

*In TDD, the code evolves in small, testable increments, ensuring that every piece of code is thoroughly tested and that the software remains functional as new features are added.*

```
what is pytest (concise)?
```

### Code Coverage via codecov and GitHub Actions <a name="codecov"></a>

```
what is code coverage?
```

ChatGPT:

*Code coverage is a software testing metric that measures the percentage of source code executed during testing. It helps assess how thoroughly a test suite exercises a program’s codebase, identifying untested parts of the code.*

*Code coverage can be measured in several ways, including:*

1. *Line Coverage: Measures how many lines of code are executed.*
2. *Branch Coverage: Evaluates whether all branches (e.g., if-else conditions) are tested.*
3. *Function/Method Coverage: Checks if all functions or methods have been called.*
4. *Statement Coverage: Assesses if every individual statement has been executed.*

*Higher code coverage suggests better testing but doesn't guarantee the absence of bugs or the quality of tests. It’s used to guide testing efforts and improve overall software reliability.*

### Generative AI Policy <a name="genAI"></a>

The purpose of this course is to learn new skills. In my personal opinion, the biggest risk of using generative AI tools in this class is that you will deprive yourself of the opportunity to learn new skills in an environment with many resources to support you. That being said, it is completely normal to use any resources that you have access to to figure out how to solve problems while you are coding (e.g., [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)). To this end, the core idealogical tenant of the course generative AI policy is that ultimately **you** are responsible for the accuracy and validity of the final products that you create, and **you** are responsible for what you get out of this course.

For english language text generated by AI, please indicate when you have used an AI tool to write any portion of the text (e.g., what I have done on this page). If you are unsure about what "counts" in this context, please err on the side of over-reporting generative AI use (e.g., "ChatGPT was used to write a first draft, available *here*, the final version reported on this page is the result of extensive edits to the generated text").

For every course assignment, please include in the relevant GitHub repository a text file titled "assignment_#_genAIuse.txt". In the text file, please state what tools were used and how. If you did not use any of these tools, please simply state "no AI tools were used to complete this assignment." We are collecting this data for information purposes only, as long as you take full responsibility for the functionality of the code you are allowed (though not necessarily encouraged) to use generative AI tools as a part of your workflow.

### Instructions for This Repository <a name="instructions"></a>

#### Get a copy of the repository on your local machine

The best way to do this is to create a GitHub account and ``clone`` the repository.

#### Create and activate a conda virtual environment

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your local machine.
2. Open a ``Terminal`` session.
3. Type in the terminal to create a virtual environment with conda:
```bash
conda create --name setup-examples-env python=3.9.13
```
4. Type in the terminal to activate your virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate setup-examples-env
```
5. Check to make sure that the correct version of python is running (should be ``3.9.13``)
```bash
python --version
```
6. Update some base modules (just in case)
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

Note that once you have created this virtual environment you can ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` it in the future -- it is not necessary to create a new virtual environment each time you want to run this code, you can simply type ``conda activate setup-examples-env`` and then pick up where you left off.

#### Install setup-example

1. Use a ``Terminal`` session to navigate to the ``setup-example-main`` folder. The command ``cd`` will allow you to do this (see: )
2. Type the command ``ls`` and make sure that the file ``pyproject.toml`` is in the current directory.
3. Now, create an editable install of wound compute:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
4. If you would like to see what packages this has installed, you can type ``pip list``
5. You can test that the code is working with pytest (all tests should pass):
```bash
pytest -v --cov=setupexample  --cov-report term-missing
```
6. To run the code from the terminal, simply start python (type ``python``) and then type ``from setupexample import example_functions as ef``. For example:
```bash
(setup-examples-env) eml-macbook-pro:setup-example-main emma$ python
Python 3.9.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) 
[Clang 13.0.1 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from setupexample import example_functions as ef
>>> ef.hello_world()
>>> "hello world!
```
