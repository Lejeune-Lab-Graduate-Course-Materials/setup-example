The purpose of this repository is to document an outline of the steps that go into setting up a very basic software development environment. This specific configuration is not mandatory for the ME 500 class, but we believe that the strategies suggested here will be helpful and useful. In some places, I have used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to make creating this readme file easier. Any text primarily written by ChatGPT is reported in *italic font* (in some cases I have made edits and/or added additional information). I have independently verified all text generated by ChatGPT and take responsibility for its content.

### General Philosophy

One of the goals of this course is to increase comfort with open source software (both as a user and as a potential contributor). When using open source software, it's important to learn how to figure things out as you go along, and not overly rely on being able to follow a step by step tutorial for everything that you need to do (though well done tutorials are fantastic!). When something doesn't work as initially planned, there are several different strategies that you can use to figure out what to do next (e.g., take some time to think about the problem, try and break the problem down into smaller more manageable pieces, search online for an answer, post on a forum etc.). The best next step will depend on the problem, and figuring out how to navigate this is part of the process. To this end, please view this setup guide as a resource page rather than a specific list of instructions. It will require some non-trivial amount of effort to get comfortable with all of these tools -- that is normal!

### Command Line
```
how do you concisely define the terminal (computer programming)?
```

ChatGPT:

*In computer programming, a terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system by entering and executing commands, typically through a command-line shell like Bash or Command Prompt. It is used for tasks such as running scripts, managing files, and controlling processes.*

```
how do you access the terminal on linux, max, and windows machines respectively?
```
ChatGPT:

*Hereâ€™s how to access the terminal on each system:*

*Linux: Most Linux distributions have a terminal pre-installed.
To open it, press Ctrl + Alt + T or search for "Terminal" in the application menu.*

*macOS: Open Spotlight Search (press Cmd + Space) and type "Terminal." Alternatively, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.*

*Windows: For the Command Prompt, press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter. For PowerShell, press Win + X and choose Windows PowerShell or search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu. Alternatively, use Windows Terminal by searching "Windows Terminal" in the Start menu (available in recent versions). Please note that newest version of PowerShell might not be installed.*

Overall, the best way to learn how to use the terminal is to just give it a try! The resources provided below include tutorials to get started on your own computer. Basic abilities in command line programming will be necesary for this course.
